A wet shaving workshop for the hedonistic gentle-person,  with a focus on what you need to get started with vintage shaving and how to extract more pleasure from your shaving routine.

We will try to answer the questions of _Why vintage/wet shave?_, _How?_, _What with?_ during the workshop, and instead of giving you a paper hand-out that you'll lose, leave you with a bottle of self-made shaving oil and this digital version of the handout that you can share, redistribute, remix, and always come back to.

Hugs,  
Schatz & Bobschi

# Introductory Words

Let's get one thing out of the way at the beginning: if you attended our workshop at a burn, thank you for attending, and welcome! We hope we can help you jog your memory. If you found this by accident, welcome! We hope this wets your appetite, and gives you the pointers that you are looking for.

Whatever brought you here, we thank you for taking the time to read this.

So, Vintage Shaving: what is it, and why should you care? 

First off, we're talking about _vintage shaving_ and not _wet shaving_ because we are explicitly not including cartridge or disposable razors, and other more modern inventions like shaving foams in a can, that are supposed to make your shaves faster and more convenient, but do so only at the cost of creating a ton of waste, if they even achieve that goal.

For us, vintage shaving is a set of items and techniques that have been around for a long time, and have been continuously developed and refined over time. 

- time efficiency
- cost
- feeling 
- luxury
